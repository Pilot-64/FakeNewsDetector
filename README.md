# FakeNewsDetector

Hello!

This project was built by @Pilot-64 to be a basework for a Fake News Detector. This code was based around this project but has been heavily modified: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fake-news-detection-model-using-tensorflow-in-python/. By utilising Tensorflow as well as the Flask API, it allows for the code to work together so that it can deliever somewhat accurate predictions about the legitamacy of news titles. Please keep in mind that this can deliever predictions, but is never 100% accurate.
